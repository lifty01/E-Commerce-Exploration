# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
The project consisted in filtering and cleaning data across various tables and afterwards, trying to find some sort of link and relationship between various columns and tables. 

## Process
### My step 1 was to firstly play around with the data to see what I thought was interesting, what I wanted to keep, what I thought wasn't relevant and checking to see what exactly I would have to do to filter and standardize my datasets and have something a little easier to work with when trying to build and discover links between tables.
### After exploring the data, it was time to clean it. I decided for the most part to remove duplicates, remove (mostly) empty or irrelevant columns, replacing data that didn't mean anything with something else, and converting units into something more readable. When the data cleaning process was done, I was able to more easily compare data between tables and try to develop links between different columns in terms of revenue by country, customer engagement with the website and their orders and stock levels for example.

## Results
These results are not exhaustive. During the project, I did find that the results were only from a few summer months in 2017. There seemed to be quite a dip in revenue for the month of August, for example. Sometimes, expected results yielded no interesting links between tables and columns, such as the ratio between total revenue and the amount of time spent on the website. However, there were also results that were unsurpring such as the United States ordering the most from the website. There were also a lot of Youtube, Google and Android products, and Google Nests seemed to be very popular in the United States. T-Shirts also seemed to be the least compelling products. The office and drinkware categories were the most popular ones, with a Ballpoint LED light pen being the top product purchased and water bottle products specifically in the United States.

## Challenges 
The challenges for this project were mostly about sorting through the data. There were a lot of mismatched records for example, especially as they were spread out throughout a few tables. It was a bit tricky to decide which data was relevant and which I should keep/delete. But while there was already a lot of data, it also felt like not enough data/information was given either. Cleaning the data turned out to be a greater task than I anticipated. After I thought I was done and started exploring through my "cleaned-up" tables, I realized that a few things had escaped me and managed to remain in the database. And so because of that, I had to modify my queries to, for example, not include NULL values, or values that were set to 0.

## Future Goals
If given more time, I definitely would have gone back and cleaned up my data some more to make sure I got to everything. I think I would have also liked a little more data that was relevant, for example, the rest of the 2017 year as opposed to only a few months. I would have also liked to be able to add metadata to give more context to my cleaned up table. I also would have liked to have been able to make graphs and plots to better represent the data I was isolating other than in table form.
